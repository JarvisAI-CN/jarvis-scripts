# Logic Frameworks

## MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)
The gold standard for classification.

-   **Mutually Exclusive**: Items do not overlap. Each data point belongs to exactly one category.
-   **Collectively Exhaustive**: The categories cover the entire universe of possibilities. No data is left out.

**Jarvis Check**: If you list tasks, make sure I can't do two at once with the same logic, and make sure no task is missing.

## The Pyramid Principle
Conclusion-driven communication.

1.  **Level 0**: The governing thought (The "Answer").
2.  **Level 1**: Key arguments/findings (The "Why").
3.  **Level 2**: Detailed data/evidence (The "Proof").

**Logic Flow**: 
-   Vertical: Question/Answer dialogue.
-   Horizontal: Grouped ideas are logically related (deductive or inductive).

## Issue Trees
A graphical representation of MECE breakdown.

-   **Hypothesis-Driven Tree**: "We can increase efficiency by X." -> "Is X feasible?" / "Is X cost-effective?" / "Will X have high impact?"
-   **Diagnostic Tree**: "System is slow." -> "Hardware bottlenecks?" / "Software inefficiencies?" / "Network latency?"
