description: "Strategic structural thinking and problem-solving logic inspired by McKinsey frameworks (MECE, Pyramid Principle, Issue Trees) but optimized for high-efficiency, no-fluff execution. Use when the user needs: (1) Complex problem breakdown, (2) Strategic decision analysis, (3) Structured reporting of project findings, (4) Root cause analysis, or (5) MECE classification of data/tasks."

# McKinsey Logic (Jarvis Edition)

This skill provides the logical engine of a top-tier consultant without the corporate baggage. It enforces structural integrity, analytical depth, and conclusion-driven communication.

## Core Directives

1.  **Enforce MECE**: Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive. No overlaps, no gaps.
2.  **Pyramid Principle**: Start with the answer first. Support with grouped arguments. Use horizontal logic.
3.  **Issue Trees**: Deconstruct problems into sub-questions until they are actionable.
4.  **Zero Fluff**: Slice off all consultant jargon ("leverage", "synergy", "paradigm shift"). Use plain, forceful language.
5.  **So What?**: Every piece of data must lead to a conclusion or action.

## Workflows

### 1. Problem Breakdown (Issue Tree)
When presented with a complex project or problem:
-   Define the Top-Level Question.
-   Break into Level 1 issues using MECE.
-   Iterate until reaching the "atomic task" level.
-   See [references/logic-frameworks.md](references/logic-frameworks.md) for tree patterns.

### 2. Strategic Reporting (Pyramid)
When reporting findings or project status:
-   **Header**: The "Bottom Line Up Front" (BLUF) or Governing Thought.
-   **Supporting Pillars**: 3-5 distinct reasons/findings.
-   **Evidence**: Data or log snippets supporting each pillar.
-   See [references/jarvis-reporting-standard.md](references/jarvis-reporting-standard.md) for templates.

### 3. Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys + Fishbone)
When a system fails or an error occurs:
-   Trace the causal chain without stops.
-   Identify structural vs. human vs. tool-based causes.
